    "\n",
    "Class\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure, behaviour, and attributes that an object of that class will have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a class \"Car\". A car class can define attributes such as \"Brand\", \"Model\", and \"color\", as well as methods like \"Maximum_speed\" or \"Accelerate\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Object\n",
    "- An Object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurence of the class, created based on the class's blueprint. Objects have their own unique identity and can have distinct values for the attributes defined in the class. "

    "Ans: The __init__() function is a special method in python classes that is automatically called when an object of the class is instantiated or created. It is used to initialize the attributes or properties of the object. It helps for object initialization, Attribute Assignment, and Customization"
